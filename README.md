Firefighting resources are based on forest firefighting land vehicles with water tanks, which can have different capacities.
Ignitions are understood as several fronts of the same forest fire.

Each folder has 10 instances with the data for each problem:
    - 20I_5R -> 20 ignitions and 5 resources;
    - 20I_7R -> 20 ignitions and 7 resources;
    - 20I_10R -> 20 ignitions and 10 resources;
    - 30I_5R -> 30 ignitions and 5 resources;
    - 30I_7R -> 30 ignitions and 7 resources;
    - 30I_10R -> 30 ignitions and 10 resources.

Each file has:
    - the travel time between the base (fire station) and the ignitions and between ignitions;
    - the burned area for each ignition and each instant of time;
    - the required water for each ignition and each instant of time;
    - the water tank capacities of each resource;
    - coordinates of each ignition;
    - ignition location network.
